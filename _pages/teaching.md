    subscription: "Course Description: In this course, we will explore the interplay between psychology and politics, both uncovering psychological roots of political behavior and bringing socio-political perspectives to psychological processes. We will address a series of debates and questions including: What strategies halt or facilitate reconciliation between antagonistic groups? To what extent does genetic variation influence one's political attitudes? How do politicians motivate and persuade voters by appealing to their emotions? In what way do cognitive biases shape the manner in which we act and think about political phenomena?"
