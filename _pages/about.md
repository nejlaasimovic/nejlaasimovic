Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania (Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics). In the Fall of 2024, I will be joining Georgetown Universityâ€™s McCourt School of Public Policy as an Assistant Professor of Computational Social Science.

My research examines the interplay between digital technologies and intergroup relations globally. My work has been published in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_, _Research & Politics_, and _Political Science Research & Methods_. I was formerly a recipient of _the United States Institute of Peace-Minerva fellowship_, _the 2022 Meta PhD Research fellowship_, and _the National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement fellowship_.

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from New York University and a B.A. (Summa Cum Laude; Phi Beta Kappa) in World Politics with minors in Mathematics and Hispanic Studies from Hamilton College. Apart from my research, I enjoy competitive ballroom dancing and refining my chocolate tasting skills.
