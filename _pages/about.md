Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania ([Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/research/centers/institute-for-the-study-of-citizens-and-politics)), and a Research Associate at the [Center for Social Media and Politics](https://csmapnyu.org/people/#single/0), New York University. In the fall of 2024, I will be joining Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy as an Assistant Professor of Computational Social Science.

My research broadly examines group dynamics within deeply divided societies, with a focus on the interplay between digital technologies and interethnic relations.

What are the causal effects of social media in post-conflict contexts, specifically concerning interethnic relations? In what ways can digital tools be used to enhance public service delivery for vulnerable groups, including migrants and refugees? How does intergroup contact during youth shape individuals' perspectives and interactions with outgroup members throughout their adult lives? Taking an interdisciplinary theoretical approach, I conduct research on these questions in countries worldwide, from my home country of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the United States, Cyprus, Israel, Colombia, Northern Ireland, and South Africa. While I hold a particular interest in causal inference, I employ a variety of methods in my studies.

My work has been published in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/25/e2022819118) (featured in [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/we-know-less-about-social-media-than-we-think), [El País](https://elpais.com/tecnologia/2021-06-23/y-si-las-redes-no-tuvieran-tanta-culpa-de-la-polarizacion-se-multiplican-las-explicaciones-alternativas.html), [Tech Policy Press](https://techpolicy.press/new-research-on-facebook-use-in-bosnia-and-herzegovina-underscores-complexity-of-relationship-between-social-media-and-social-dynamics/), [Epsiloon](/s/AsimovicInterview_Epsiloon.pdf)); [Research & Politics](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20531680231205157); forthcoming in *Political Science Research & Methods*; and has received support from the [National Science Foundation Dissertation Improvement Grant](https://politicalsciencenow.com/meet-nejla-asimovic-2020-apsa-doctoral-dissertation-research-improvement-grantee/), [United States Institute of Peace-Minerva fellowship](https://www.usip.org/grants-fellowships/jennings-randolph-peace-scholarship-dissertation-program/former-peace-scholars), [NYU Dean’s Dissertation fellowship](https://gsas.nyu.edu/financial-support/fellowships/gsas-dissertation-fellowships.html#identifier2), [2022 Meta PhD Research fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2022/2/announcing-the-recipients-of-the-2022-meta-phd-research-fellowship/), and [Innovations for Poverty Action](https://www.poverty-action.org/program-area/peace-and-recovery/competitive-fund-peace-and-recovery).

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from New York University and a B.A. (*Summa Cum Laude; Phi Beta Kappa*) in World Politics with minors in Mathematics and Hispanic Studies from Hamilton College. Beyond my research, I enjoy competitive ballroom dance along with honing my chocolate tasting skills.
