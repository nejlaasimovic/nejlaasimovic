  - title: "Testing the Effects of Facebook Usage in an Ethnically Polarized Setting"

    abstract: "Despite the belief that social media is altering intergroup dynamics – bringing people closer or further alienating them from one another – the impact of social media on inter-ethnic attitudes has yet to be rigorously evaluated, especially within areas with tenuous inter-ethnic relations. We report results from a randomized controlled trial in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), exploring the effects of exposure to social media during a week of genocide remembrance in July 2019 on a set of inter-ethnic attitudes of Facebook users. We find evidence that, counter pre-registered expectations, people who deactivated their Facebook profiles report lower regard for ethnic out-groups than those who remained active. Moreover, we present additional evidence suggesting that this effect is conditional on the level of ethnic heterogeneity of respondents' residence. We also extend the analysis to include measures of subjective well-being and knowledge of news. Here, we find that Facebook deactivation leads to suggestive improvements in subjective well-being and a decrease in the knowledge of current events, replicating results from recent research in the U.S. in a very different context, thus increasing our confidence in the generalizability of these effects."
  - title: "Replicating the Effects of Facebook Deactivation in an Ethnically Polarized Setting"
    subtitle: "(with Jonathan Nagler and Joshua A. Tucker)"

    abstract: "The question of how social media usage impacts societal polarization continues to generate great interest among both the research community and broader public. Nevertheless, there are still very few rigorous empirical studies of the causal impact of social media usage on polarization. To address this gap, we replicate the only published study to date that tests the effects of social media usage on interethnic attitudes (Asimovic et al., 2021). In a study situated in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the authors found that remaining active on Facebook for a week, versus deactivating from Facebook, had a positive effect on users' attitudes toward ethnic outgroups, with the positive effect driven by users with more ethnically homogeneous offline networks. Does this finding extend to other settings? In a pre-registered replication study, we implement the same research design in a different ethnically polarized setting: Cyprus. We are not able to replicate the main effect found in (Asimovic et al., 2021): in Cyprus, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no effect. We do, however, find a significant interaction between the heterogeneity of users' offline networks and the deactivation treatment within our 2021 subsample, consistent with the pattern from Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also find support for recent findings (Allcott et al., 2020; Asimovic et al., 2021). that Facebook deactivation leads to a reduction in anxiety levels, and to a decrease in the knowledge of current news."
  - title: "Estimating the effect of intergroup contact over years: Evidence from a youth program in Israel"
    subtitle: "(with Ruth Ditlmann and Cyrus Samii)"
    version: "paper"
    text: "Accepted, Political Science Research and Methods "
    abstract: "We study how an intervention combining youth intergroup contact and sports affects intergroup relations in the context of an active conflict. We first conduct an RCT of one-year program exposure in Israel. To track effects of a multiyear exposure, we then use machine learning techniques to fuse the RCT with the observational data gathered on multiyear participants. This analytical approach can help overcome frequent limitations of RCTs, such as modest sample sizes and short observation periods. Our evidence cannot affirm a one-year effect on outgroup regard and ingroup regulation, although we estimate benefits of multiyear exposure among Jewish-Israeli youth, particularly boys. We discuss implications for interventions in contexts of active conflict and group status asymmetry."
